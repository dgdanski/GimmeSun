Hi,</br>
The task was divided into two parts:
1. The page should show 5-day weather forecast for given city including:
* Morning temperature
* Day temperature
* Night temperature
* Humidity
2. The page should also show following stats relevant to weather forecast:
* Minimum value
* Maximum value
* Mean value
* Mode value
</br>

As of lack of the time, I've done the first part. The second one can be discussed how I would do that. 
I think that the code you can see, it sufficiently embraces my concept (way) of app making.

Things worth to admit:
1. Code was written quickly.
2. There is no request error handling, only check for the Internet connection.
3. Interface doesn't look very well, it just accomplishes its task at the very basic level - shows the result and that's it.
4. The main goal for me to achieve was to write the app in a simple way and make code easy to read and understand.

# How to run?
Download, compile, run code in Android Studio and enjoy.
